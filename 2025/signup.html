              <b>It‚Äôs Mean Time.</b>

              <br>
              <br>
              Racing through streets in the 1st Romanesque: plantagenet churches & gathering-halls speed by your vision like 
              special effect frames. 
              <br>
              <br>Wind whips your hair.
              <br>
              Like being shot through the center of a kaleidoscope. <br>

              You know this Cobblestone Highway is Greenwich High Street but at these speeds these familiar locales are
               psychedelic swirls, it's like you're watching the last few years of your life in hi-rpm fast-forward, soundtrack to match. Something shatters behind you and goes silent before than is natural.
               <br>
               <br>
              A resting-bell is hit ‚Äì no doubt in the Royal Observatory, your destination. 
              Echoes bounce off of stone facades in all directions, teasing you Doppler-style as you round each corner.
              You know the way: plaster walls, wrought iron ornaments, Thames then around The River Neckinger, back to Thames, around 
              the Ravensbourne and soon to Deptford Creek. Emerging from crowded
              streets and back alleys in the Thames districts: boardlehouses, tavernas, back-doors of churches, urban abbeys, cascades of fabric dyed red, suddenly a greenhill.
              <br>
              <br>
              Marathon rocket race almost over: you're unbearably close now! But you fear the Boats are closer. A quick glance confirms, ships superimposed on the Isle of Dogs. You can't rest, you have to give it your all, you have to keep going.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Observatory quakes as the Bell tolls again. Something is happening in the tower.
              Red orb and compass are vibrating atop the tower like Tuning Fork Tines. How does the building stay together? The oldest buildings in this town always seem to be the most sturdy.
              <br><br>
              They said the Greyking was a story ‚Äì thousand year-old myth ‚Äì fended off by
              a brave hero, their squier, and trusty steed-familiar. 
              By accident, by strange circumstances,¬†by fate, you've ended up here 
              ripping through the town you know like the creases in your palm.
              The boats have all but confirmed our theory: that modern agents have somehow
              located and acquired the Greyking's legendary tool: the Greyking's Bick.
              <br><br>
              What will they do at the Prime Meridian? 
              <br><br>
              What is their plan?
              <br><br>
              What is their esoteric knowledge?
              <br><br>
              Does it have to do with the strange Brass geared machines you and I have learned to blast through the city with, inventing new top speeds              ?
              <br>
              Does it have to do with the Crystals under the sewers, glittering like stars underground?
              <br><br>
              Does it have to do with the strange purple marbling spreading in the sky.
              <br><br>
              It's too late to wonder now. You'll find out soon enough. It's a race of inches, of milliseconds,
              to where you somehow always knew it would end: the Prime Meridian, the invisible ethereal wall that cuts Gaia in half.

              <br>
              Keep the pedal to the metal, twist the throttle. Every muscle tensed, everything pushing forward just one more inch, to keep going. You need to win this race, however impossible. Perhaps there is a forgotten benevolent force. You begin to shimmer in a (?)Rainbow(?) haze‚Ä¶
              <br><br>

            
              It‚Äôs Mean Time.

              Thank the Mother Goddess: despite years of technological improvement thanks to the waterwheels on the Thames, MiDi is still as relevant as ever!
              Nevertheless, our celebrations are for 
              <b>General MiDi</b> in particular which is an amazing standard that could use more love!
              Yipeedee: every year we come together to honor this underappreciated standard!
              <br>
              We love MiDi and the radiant power of
              elegant, useful standards!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              YIPEE!
