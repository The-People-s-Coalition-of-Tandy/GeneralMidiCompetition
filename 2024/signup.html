              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Uh-oh, Travelers! The annual celebration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI">General MiDi</a>
              has arrived in a time of DANGER for the ZRainbow.
              Lest the Grayking grey the ZRainbow, the MiDi must flow!
              We're so glad you have decided to join us for this special jubilee - an artful rest - 
              as we power the Geometrie up with MiDi so that it may ward 
              the Grayking's "Grayking Bick".
              <br/>
              <br>
              Here at P.C.o.T. we are not Worewéd or Afearéd...
              <br>
              In fact....... :::::<br>
              <br>
              It is portentéd that this year's competition will go on smoothly
              as it's number of 31 (thirty-one) is in fact PRIME and NON-FACTORABLE, as is our
              SOLITARY MiDi in its GREATNESS!!
              <br/>
              <br>
              Thank the pantheons: For after all these years, MiDi is still as relevant as ever!
              Nevertheless, our celebrations are for 
              General MiDi which is an amazing standard that could use more love!
              Welaway: every year we come together to honor this underappreciated standard!
              <br>
              We love MiDi and the POWER of
              ELEGANT, USEFUL STANDARDS!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              YIPEE!

                  ◊ Engraving software such as Sibelius, MuseScore, Finale, and Dorico are all General MIDI capable and can seamlessly format arrangements into General MIDI.

              	 ◊ DAWs such as Reaper, Ableton, Cubase, Logic, and Pro Tools can also generate General MIDI files, but Program Changes (ie. instrument selections) must be inputted manually. Certain DAWs may not be GM-compliant in their playback system, but that should not be a problem as long as you translate your program changes to their corresponding GM instruments. For those, there are many GM Soundfonts available which you can load into a sampler or sfz player!
